# Raspberry Pi Face and Eye Tracking

Based on the method ‘Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features’ proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones, this raspberry pi project realizes the function of face and eye tracking in real-time webcam or video by using python, RPI camera module and Haar feature-based cascade classifiers from open source computer vision library (OpenCV). 

Hardware aspect, I designed, built and test the portable mini touch-screen raspberry pi-powered Linux laptop with impressive, sleek, minimalistic, beautiful appearance. RPI camera module and slim power bank were also assembled. 

This project helps gain basic computer vision knowledge in Haar-like feature, Integral Image, Adaboost and Cascading. Moreover, the Python programming, problem-solving and self-taught skills are also greatly improved.
